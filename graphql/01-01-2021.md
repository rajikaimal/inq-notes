# Dataloader

- https://github.com/graphql/dataloader

- Dataloader is used as a utility in the data fetching layer to optimize the performance
- Two major usecases
  - Batch processing
  - Caching

## Batch processing

- The main use case of dataloader, where an array is passed and returns a list of promise which resolves into subsequent values

```js
const DataLoader = require("dataloader");

const userLoader = new DataLoader((keys) => myBatchGetUsers(keys));
```

## Caching

- This doesn't replace in-memory caches like Redis or memcache (memoization cache)
- Prevents loading data repeatedly in the context of a single request

```js
.load()
```
